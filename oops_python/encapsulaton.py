Encapsulation in Python is a concept that binds the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that manipulate the data into a single unit or class.
It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which helps prevent unintended interference and misuse.

In Python, encapsulation is achieved by using private variables and methods. Private variables are declared by prefixing an attribute or method with
double underscores (__). These variables are not accessible directly from outside the class. Instead, they are accessed through getter and setter methods,
which allows for controlled access and modification of the data.

Encapsulation helps in data hiding, as the internal representation of an object is hidden from the outside world. This allows the object to maintain
its internal state without being directly manipulated by external code. It also helps in reducing the complexity of the code and makes it easier to
maintain and debug.

Overall, encapsulation is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming that promotes better code organization,
 reusability, and security.
